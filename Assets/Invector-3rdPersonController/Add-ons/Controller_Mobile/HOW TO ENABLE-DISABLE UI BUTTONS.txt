- The content inside each folder requires each template to work. 

If you don't own the MeleeCombat Template or the Shooter Template, you can delete the folder to avoid any errors.

- When using the Inventory, you can use the component vCheckItemIsEquipped to check if a specific item or specific ItemType is equipped 
so you can enable/disable specific buttons, for example, when using a shooter weapon disable the melee attack and block button and enable the shot button.

- When using the No-Inventory, use the vCollectShooterMeleeControl Events to enable/disable UI Buttons, it has less filters then the vCheckItemIsEquipped 
so you can only verify is a melee or shooter weapons is equipped/unequiped.

- To enable the Action button, go to your character inspector and open the GenericAction Events OnEnterTriggerAction/OnExitTriggerAction to enable/disable the Action button UI.
It's important to keep the UI object inside your player, so you can reference the events without losing the assigned parameters in the inspector if you change the scene.
